a03-047-00.png	It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson
a03-047-01.png	in the role of a propular orator at the
a03-047-02.png	hustings , the spellbinder that Mr. Diefen-
a03-047-03.png	baker was in the lost two campaigns . The
a03-047-04.png	impression remains that the Liberal leader
a03-047-05.png	is still the diprdomatist , more at home
a03-047-06.png	in the chancery , or the corridors of the United
a03-047-07.png	Nations , not the father figure , so necessary
a03-047-08.png	in Canadian leadership , or the practical
a03-047-09.png	politician , able to talk about sewage problens
a03-047-10.png	in Algoma East .
